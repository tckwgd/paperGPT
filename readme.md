# Interactive Paper Generator

The Interactive Paper Generator is a tool based on the OpenAI GPT model that assists in the rapid generation of various sections of academic papers. It allows users to generate sections such as introductions, innovations, related work, methodology, conclusions, discussions, abstracts, and references tailored to specific requirements.

## Features

- **Multiple GPT Model Support**: Choose between GPT-3 and GPT-4 models for generating text.
- **BibTeX Integration**: Upload your BibTeX files to include precise citations directly within your generated papers.
- **Customizable Section Generation**: Set word limits and generate specific sections individually.
- **Complete Paper Generation**: Option to generate an entire paper with one click using default word limits.
- **Editable Outputs**: Generated texts can be edited within the application to refine and tailor the output further.
